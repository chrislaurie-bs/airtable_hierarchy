Hierarchy makes it simple and intuitive to navigate a self related table. Navigate from root to branches and only ever see the records at one level. If you are many levels deep in your navigation you can immediately jump to any of the ancestor hiigher levels by using the handy set of navigation links that Hierarchy displays at the top of the screen.

Using Hirarchy's quick add functionality, allows you to quickly add a new row to your table at the spot where you want it.

You can also directly edit any of the rows on display by using the expand button on the row.
