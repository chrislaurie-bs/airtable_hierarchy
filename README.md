# Hierarchy

Hierarchy is an [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) custom block created out of a need I had and as an entry into the [custom block conetst](https://community.airtable.com/t/new-custom-blocks-contest-with-100-000-in-prizes/30140).

Hierarchy makes it simple and intuitive to navigate a self related table. Navigate from root to branches to eventual childless leaves and only ever see the records at one level.
